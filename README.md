# osu-dll-injection

A small, lightweight injector designed to run for osu. 
Has two command line arguments, `-d` for DirectX and `o` for OpenGL
(Yet it doesn't support paths, but I will implement that later)

Usage: `injector.exe -d` will perform an injection to osu!.exe. Make sure
it runs in compatibilty mode
`-o` will do the same but it has to be run without compatibility mode.
